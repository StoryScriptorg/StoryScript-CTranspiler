# StoryScript-CTranspiler

This is the StoryScript to C version of StoryScript. It will transpile StoryScript code to C code.

## Purpose of this

With this version, You can transpile the StoryScript code to C. Which means you can compile them and Use StoryScript as an Executable.

Note that this version is **not stable.**

## Packages required

To use C transpiler properly, You'll need a package called `tqdm` installed. Just type this \(If you have installed Python properly\):

```text
pip install tqdm
```
or
```text
python -m pip install tqdm
```

If it throws an Error saying that `python` does not exist, Then python executable is not in your Environment path.
